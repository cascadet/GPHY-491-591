    "# GPHY 491-591: Lab 2 \n",
    "Written by Cascade Tuholske, Jan. 2024  \n",
    "\n",
    "### <u> Goals <u>\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to pratice writing code with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib using a real-world dataset. The dataset was developed to understand the relationship between child undernutrition, measured by [USAID Demographic and Health Surveys](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/demographic-and-health-surveys-program), and national-level indicators of economic development. Child undernutrition is often broken into two categories: low weight for age (stunting - reflecting chronic food insecurity) and low weight for height (wasting - reflecting acute food insecurity). <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Orthodox theories of economic development posit that as a country urbanizes, its economy grows and food security improves. Thus, more urbanized countries should be more food secure compared to more rural countries. Further, within a country, urban areas should be more food secure compared to rural areas.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will explore this dataset to understand if economic development and food security are well-correlated, and see what proxy indecators of economic development may also correlate with child food insecurity. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <u> Instruction <u>\n",
    "1. Please rename your notebook as: `Last_First_Lab1` **NOTE:** Naming convetions matter for files, including notebooks and data. Always be consistant. \n",
    "2. Complete lab by writing code or answering questions in the cells as in structed by the comments.\n",
    "3. Copy your notebook to `/home/YOURNETID/gphy591/submissions/`\n",
