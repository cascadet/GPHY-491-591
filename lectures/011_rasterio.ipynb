    "[<span class=\"codeb\">Geographic Information Systems</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) (GIS) allow for visualizing, manipulating, and analyzing human and environmental geographic data. But GIS platforms have limited utility because (1) it can be difficult to reproduce work flows with a GIS and (2) processing large volumes of data inefficent with a GIS graphical user interface (GUI). Further, GIS platforms tend to be a black box that do not allow you to fully understand how your data is being processed. \n",

    "[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) is an open-source Python library that enables the use and maniplation of raster data. Most often used for remote-sensed or weather/climate data, raster data is a spatial grid in which each cell is ascribe a numeric or float point value. Often, raster values actually mean something physical (e.g. a global map of daily maximum temperature may be in ¬∞C). But they also can be used to classify grid cells (e.g. a value of 0, means ocean and a value of 1 means land). \n",

This file contains an estimated daily maximum air temperature values from [CHIRTS-daily](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirtsdaily), a dataset I helped build during my PhD. CHIRTS-daily leverages the temporal accuracy of weather stations with the spatial coverage of weather satellites to produce a continuous ~5km grid of daily maximum temperatures from 1983-2016. This is really important, because much of the planet does not have weather station data. In fact, about 4 billion people live more than 25 km from a weather station (see our paper in [Environmental Research Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac30c0/pdf)."
