    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) (\"Python Data Analysis Library\") is arguably the most important tool for data scientists using Python. As the central component of the Python data science toolkit, pandas is essentially where your data will \"live\" when you're working in Python. Pandas is built on [NumPy](https://numpy.org), which means that many of the data structures of NumPy are used in pandas. Data stored in pandas `DataFrame`s are often analysed statistically in [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/), visualized using plotting functions from [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and fed into machine learning algorithms in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n"

    "- Merge: Uses [`pd.merge()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function to align rows from two DataFrames based on common keys, similar to SQL joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can use the [`pd.join()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) function to join two datasets, with different methods. Join Types:\n",
    "- Inner Join: Only rows with matching keys in both DataFrames.\n",
    "- Outer Join: All rows from both DataFrames, with NaNs for missing matches.\n",
    "- Left Join: All rows from the left DataFrame, and matching rows from the right, with NaNs for missing matches.\n",

    "1. **Absolute Paths**: These provide the complete details needed to locate a file, starting from the root element of the file system. Example: `'C:/Users/username/Documents/file.txt'`\n",
    "2. **Relative Paths**: These are partial paths based on the current working directory. They are more flexible for projects that might be moved to a different folder structure. Example: `'./data/Ghana-2014-DHS-Household-Filtered.csv'`"
