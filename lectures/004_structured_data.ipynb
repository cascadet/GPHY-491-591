    "# Interactive Session: Structured Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the easiest mental model for thinking about structured data is a spreadsheet. You are all familiar with Excel spreadsheets, with their numbered rows and lettered columns. In the spreadsheet, data is often \"structured\" so that each row is an entry, and each column is perhaps a variable recorded for that entry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental data map really well to this model, especially data collected over time. A spreadsheet of weather observations would have a new row for each observation period, and then the columns would be the meteorological data that was collected at that time. As we move into our data science tools, we will see that a major aspect of these tools is creating efficient ways of working with structured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, Python has a number of built-in data types that can be used to organize data in a structured manner. These basic data types containing structured data are all lumped into a single broad category called `collections`. Within these `collection` data types, some of the data types are `sequences`, which means that the items in the `collection` have a deterministic ordering. You've already used the two most common `sequence` data types: the **string** and the **list**. A **string** is simply an ordered collection of characters, while a **list** data type  structures a collection of anything into an ordered series of elements that can be referenced by their position in the **list**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to learn about an additional `sequence`, called a **tuple**, as well as two `collection` data types called sets (**set**) and dictionaries (**dict**). \n",
