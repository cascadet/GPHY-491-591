    "Humans create [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) and, as such, humans are incredibly difficult to study. Even counting how many people there on the planet is difficult. Many large countries - which we think have rapidly growing populations - have not had a [reliable census conducted in decades](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1715305115). Even the United States, which has a well-regarded and well-funded census, has trouble [estimating population](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.11.002). \n",

    "Human population data is very powerful. In the US, **\\$2.8 Trillion** is distributed based on Census data. That's a lot of money. Human data can also be used in nefarious ways too. Governments can rig elections by stuffing districts and governments can oppress groups if they can count them. The power of This is all to say, that while human data is really important for sustainability, there are true ethical considerations when developing and using human datasets.  \n",

    "The US Census Bureau's \"mission is to serve as the nation's leading provider of quality data about its people and economy.\" It collects, curates and disseminates a wide range of demographic and economic data. It's mission in enshrined the US constitution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Decadal Populationa and Housing Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20census%20counts%20each,of%20Representatives%20among%20the%20states.) is designed to be a complete count of people residents of the United States' territory, whereas the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) is conducted annually has uses a spatiall-informed sampling strategy to estimate demographic data for the entire country. Both surveys are quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Census, it's important to remember that how we group people changes overtime. For example, how we count Hispanic-indentifying residents of the US has [changes through time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census), just as various other racial and ethnic groups. This makes tracking specific demographics through time quite difficult. Similiarly, census boundaries can change through time - again making it difficult to measure fine-grained demographic change overtime. But the Census makes a strong effort to document changes and inform users how demographic data is collected and aggregated over space and time. \n",

    "It's useful to familiarize yourself with the various spatial domains available from the Census. While it is quite easy to download US Census data, let's use the [Python Census API](https://pygis.io/docs/d_access_census.html) to check out US Census data right in our notebook. Note that this tutorial borrows from a great online resource: [PyGIS - Open Source Spatial Programming & Remote Sensing](https://pygis.io/docs/a_intro.html). Check it out!"

You can checkout the [US Census API User Guide](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf).

    "We may want to aggregate data to the county level. This is very easy to do with `GeoPandas` and uses a spatial [`dissolve`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/aggregation_with_dissolve.html) methods just like ArcGIS or QGIS. In short, `dissolve` uses catagorical data to dissolve the boundaries between ajoining polygons with the same catagorical value. In this case, we will use the `COUNTYFP` code to disscolve the census tract level data. We will need to pass an aggregation method (see [here](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/aggregation_with_dissolve.html). In this case, we'll use `sum`."
